Hello, My name is Anuntiwat Raungtorwong, nickname's Jr.

I love coding a program but I didn't graduate in computer science instead I have the courage to work in this job 
if I didn't code once per day, I can't think clearly all day. 

Now, I learning React framework for my goal of looking for a job that suits my skill. 
I still learning but I will get better and better to prove myself that I can do it too.
